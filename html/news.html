                The voyages continue in the Star Trek universe with the complete behind-the-scenes guide to Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and Star Trek VII. With candid comments
                from the actors, writers, producers, and craftspeople who create the shows, along with credits, plot summaries, and airdates. Among with those interviewed for this all
                new volume are: Avery Brooks, Rick Berman, Majel Barrett Roddenberry, Jonathan Frakes, Winrich Kolbe, and many, many more. 1994's Star Trek: Generations
                earned $130 million which gave the green light to another Next Gen movie. William Shatner submitted a storyline that would have been a sequel to the first movie.
                Paramount rejected it, so Shatner had his storyline made into a novel. When the new movie was made the Borg were included because of their popularity as was the
                ideal of time travel and they combine them together in Star Trek's rich history. A winning combination with a director who knew the Star Trek universe. All knew that
                Star Trek VII would be a winner. Deep Space Nine is a gritty and alien atmosphere, unlike the sterile and nearly perfect utopia within the confines of a starship
                inhabited by Starfleet officers. this would create a lot of conflict that would give both the actors and writers more range in what they could do. Voyager was created to
                be another ship franchise.
